Dry rub: brown sugar, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper and fresh lemon zest. Maple syrup over the chicken, dry rub over the chicken, in the fridge for an hour. Smoked for an hour with cherry and maple. Put the chicken in a foil pan, drop butter on it and cover. Back onto the grill to roast for an hour. Made a sauce from home made bbq, buffalo hot sauce and apple juice. Dunked chicken in the sauce and smoked for a half hour with more maple and cherry. Turned the liquid into a sauce and used it for dipping. Never had chicken like this before. So good.
