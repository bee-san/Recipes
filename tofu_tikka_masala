DESCRIPTION

Enough to feed for 5 hearty meals

DIRECTIONS

1. Cut the tofu into small chunks.
2. Marinade (is this the right word???) the tofu with a mix of the spices, The paste, salt, pepper, turmeric, and anything else. Donâ€™t need much spices, just enough.
3. Leave in fridge for an hour.

About 40 minutes later, do this:
1. Get a wok and put int he coconut oil (or olive oil)
2. Put in the onions on a high temp
3. Salt the onions
4. Add about 20 cloves of garlic, or until your hand gets tired from making mincing the garlic. Whichever comes first.
6. Put the tofu into the oven to bake.
7. When the onions start to golden, put in the cubed peppers
8. Add salt and Turmeric, and mix it up until its golden
9. After 3 - 4 minutes, add about 2/3rd of the spice paste and mix it up and cook until its even more golden.
10. Add the tofu to the wok
11. Add more salt.
12. Mix the tofu with the rest of the dish.
13. Lower the temp so it simmers. Add the 2 tins of tomatoes.
14. Add more salt.
15. After a few minutes, add the rest of the spices (but not the spice paste).
16. Add the coconut milk until it looks lovely.
17. Add more salt.
18. Taste test. If it tastes too coconut, use the spice paste. We want to reserve a little bit of spice paste for the tofu next time, but if you put into much coconut milk then use the rest of it.
19. Season with coriander and salt.

20. Freeze it and serve a little with some rice. You earned it :)
